# 📒 CariOps SRE Runbooks & Automation Snippets

Welcome! This is a curated collection of practical scripts, config notes, and troubleshooting snippets gathered over 20+ years in IT infrastructure, operations, and support.

What began as a personal reference file named 'thingstoremember.txt' has grown into a living knowledge base. These scripts and notes have helped me deploy, repair, automate, and explain real-world systems — both in traditional enterprise environments and cloud-native settings, often under pressure.

Not everything from my archive made it here - you won’t find notes on hotswapping a 3Com card, for example - but what *is* here reflects what I still use, still adapt, and still trust to get things done. I hope it proves useful to you too.
